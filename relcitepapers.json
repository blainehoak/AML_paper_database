In fact, some of the latest\nfindings suggest that the existence of adversarial attacks may be an inherent\nweakness of deep learning models. To address this problem, we study the\nadversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust\noptimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much\nof the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to\nidentify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are\nreliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a\nconcrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These\nmethods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide\nrange of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against\na first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe\nthat robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an\nimportant stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.

Unfortunately, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples:\ngiven an input $x$ and any target classification $t$, it is possible to find a\nnew input $x'$ that is similar to $x$ but classified as $t$. This makes it\ndifficult to apply neural networks in security-critical areas. Defensive\ndistillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural\nnetwork, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current\nattacks' ability to find adversarial examples from $95\\%$ to $0.5\\%$.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not\nsignificantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three\nnew attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled\nneural networks with $100\\%$ probability. Our attacks are tailored to three\ndistance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to\nprevious adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much\nmore effective (and never worse). Furthermore, we propose using high-confidence\nadversarial examples in a simple transferability test we show can also be used\nto break defensive distillation.

In many cases, these modifications can\nbe so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at\nall, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose\nsecurity concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine\nlearning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model.\nUp to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary\ncan feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always\nthe case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which\nare using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows\nthat even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial\nimages obtained from cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and\nmeasuring the classification accuracy of the system.

Such attacks can seriously undermine the\nsecurity of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating\nconsequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or\nillegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems\ncan be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a\ndefensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness\nof adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the\ngeneralizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive\ndistillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of\nour defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study\nshows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation\nfrom 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be\nexplained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial\nsample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10^30. We also find that\ndistillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be\nmodified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we\ntested.\n"

        "  Adversarial examples are perturbed inputs designed to fool machine learning\nmodels. Adversarial training injects such examples into training data to\nincrease robustness. To scale this technique to large datasets, perturbations\nare crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation\nof the model's loss. We show that this form of adversarial training converges\nto a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data\npoints obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to\ngenerate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a\nresult, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box\nattacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well\nas to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity\nof the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble\nAdversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with\nperturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet, Ensemble Adversarial\nTraining yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks. In\nparticular, our most robust model won the first round of the NIPS 2017\ncompetition on Defenses against Adversarial Attacks. However, subsequent work\nfound that more elaborate black-box attacks could significantly enhance\ntransferability and reduce the accuracy of our models.\n"

For that we propose a novel method for\ngenerating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution\n(DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can\nfool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results\nshow that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and\n16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least\none target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence\non average.

Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial\nmachine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are\nalso vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an\nimportant application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in\nthe domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively\ngenerate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating\nrobustness.\n"

However, recent research on DNNs has indicated\never-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially\nfor security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous\ndriving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by\ndemonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and\nmachines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore,\nresearchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by\nsimply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model,\nknown as a black-box attack to DNNs.\n  Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we\npropose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input\n(images) and the output (confidence scores) of a targeted DNN. However,\ndifferent from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we\npropose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the\ngradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples.

These vulnerabilities\nhinder the deployment of deep learning systems where safety or security is\nimportant. Attempts to secure deep learning systems either target specific\nattacks or have been shown to be ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose MagNet, a framework for defending neural network\nclassifiers against adversarial examples.

MagNet\nincludes one or more separate detector networks and a reformer network.\nDifferent from previous work, MagNet learns to differentiate between normal and\nadversarial examples by approximating the manifold of normal examples. Since it\ndoes not rely on any process for generating adversarial examples, it has\nsubstantial generalization power. Moreover, MagNet reconstructs adversarial\nexamples by moving them towards the manifold, which is effective for helping\nclassify adversarial examples with small perturbation correctly. We discuss the\nintrinsic difficulty in defending against whitebox attack and propose a\nmechanism to defend against graybox attack.

        "  Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety- and\nsecurity-critical domains including self-driving cars and malware detection,\nwhere the correctness and predictability of a system's behavior for corner case\ninputs are of great importance. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually\nlabeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare\ninputs.\n  We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first whitebox framework\nfor systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron\ncoverage for systematically measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by\ntest inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality\nas cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate\nhow finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors\nand achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization\nproblem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques.\n  DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors\n(e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as\nbenign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons\ntrained on five popular datasets including ImageNet and Udacity self-driving\nchallenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one\ntest input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running\nonly on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by\nDeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve\nthe model's accuracy by up to 3%.\n"
